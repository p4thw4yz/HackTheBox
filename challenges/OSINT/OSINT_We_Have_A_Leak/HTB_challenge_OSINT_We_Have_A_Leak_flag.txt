Notes:
Scoured Super Secure Startup on twitter and its employees to find details.
Josh was the latest employee and had possibly been the one that achived the files so after a few tried using is username j.terranwald worked for the username zip.
Moving forward i knew that josh was the one that had done it so, the password password had to have something to do with him.
According to one of the images the old password was SupSecStart#Winter2018! Took ages to think about but he started in 2019, Josh Started in Spring 2019.
So he may have changed the password to his start season and year. password:SupSecStart#Spring2019!
