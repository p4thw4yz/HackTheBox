Description
You managed to pull some interesting files off one of Super Secure 
Startup's anonymous FTP servers. Via some OSINT work(a torrent or 
online Password breach site) you have also procured a recent data 
breach dump. Can you unlock the file and retrieve the key?

Notes
Used excel as i was on windows to csv the passwords into a file by themselves
used office2john.py to convert the docx into hash.txt
used hashcat along with the breached_password file i created t brute force, no luck.
Searched through the file for a few employees that i knew existed in super secure startup. Only found Bianka Phelps in the password list.
Could have tried her password, but instead added it to the breach password list. tried hashcat again, no luck.

Scoured the twitter page again and found all the stuff i had seen on the other challenges, felt abit lost by now.
Went away and thought about it. After i came back, i thought it must have something to do with Bianka, as she was HR as well as had active posts around the same time as the leak.
As with the previous challenge where the password was SupSecStart#$season$year!, I though I would try the same with Biankaâ€™s password.
Added Love!March2019 my password list and ran hashcat again as i was on kali and not windows at the time.

Cracked!

back over to windows I entered the password and was met with a base64 looking code so decoded and we have the HTB{flag}

python3 office2john.py key.docx > hash.txt
hashcat -a 0 -m 9600 -w 3 --username -o found.txt hash.txt breach_passwords.txt
echo -n 'SFRCe1A0c3N3MHJkX0JyM2FjaDNzX0M0bl9CM19BX1RyM2FzdXIzX1Ryb3YzXzBmX0luZjBybWF0aTBufQ==' | base64 --decode
