Description:
Blockchain data can't be deleted, and bad actors are using it 
to store blobs, we want to hunt down the user that has been 
uploading illegal pictures on the Ethereum Goerli testnet blockchain. 
We need to find one picture to use it as evidence to take him down. 
We know he was actively uploading pictures between 2020-07-30 and 2020-08-01.

Notes
Started by tracking down transactions on the Goerli testnet related to 2020-07-30 and 2020-08-01.
Lots of transactions happen but was looking for something that may stand out.
found 2 transactions from the same address 0xb7e53A55dA3EEA0fbD09566afDa143667d77527D going to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 (blocks 3142346 & 3142349)
looking into both transactions they had been made by 0xb7e53A55dA3EEA0fbD09566afDa143667d77527D
as the input was in hex, and I knew we were looking for an image, I used cyberchef and copied both inputs into cyberchef.
With the first one being the first transaction and the second, the second.
A few tries later at trying to go from hex to image, after doing abit of googling about blockchain and images I managed 
to convert the hex to an image.
