Notes
Searched social media
Frank Vitalik site:<website>
Found some freecoinz scam stuff on reddit
followed it to Steemit link : https://steemit.com/htb/@freecoinz/freecoinz
Steemit link has reference to eth address for Ropsten testnet 0x1b3247Cd0A59ac8B37A922804D150556dB837699
looked up address on Ropsten network scanner, lots of people have sent eth to it but only 2 outgoing transactions, one for 0 and another for 0.99 Eth
Looked at both
Found HTB as part of transaction message in UTF-8 format
